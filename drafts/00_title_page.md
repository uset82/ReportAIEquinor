## Abstract

Equinor has gained $330m worth from artificial intelligence since 2020, putting predictive maintenance and subsurface analysis to work across its operations (Equinor, 2026). However, in late 2024, the company reduced its renewables unit by 250 positions, a fifth of its workforce, as it invested more in AI for fossil fuel operations (Proctor, 2024).

This report uses the twin transition framework (Müller et al., 2024), responsible innovation principles (Stilgoe et al., 2013), and the ILO Just Transition guidelines (2016) to conduct a document analysis of Equinor's disclosures and relevant academic and policy literature from 2020 to 2025.

Out of the analysis three dilemmas are put forward. First, efficiency gains displace certain roles, though new positions may emerge in AI governance and human-machine collaboration (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019); the challenge is ensuring workers have voice and access to these transitions. Second, AI optimization extends the commercial life of fossil fuel assets, making it more difficult to transition to renewables. Third, sensor networks monitoring thousands of data points blur the difference between optimization and surveillance. The warnings of leading technologists are also adding to these tensions: Geoffrey Hinton argues that AI-based displacement will pick up speed by 2026 (Cable News Network, 2025), and Elon Musk believes that in 2046 work will be optional (Revell, 2025).

As a consequence of the findings, efficiency is favored by Equinor rather than protection of the workforce. Closing this gap will mean being transparent, having a real stakeholder dialogue, and making reskilling investments.
