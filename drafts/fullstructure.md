## PAPER TITLE

**Governing AI and Sustainability at Equinor: Balancing Efficiency, Ethics, and the Twin Transition**

---

## RESEARCH QUESTION

> How should Equinor govern its AI deployment to balance operational efficiency with ethical workforce transition and genuine sustainability commitments?

---

## THESIS STATEMENT

> While Equinor's AI deployment has generated approximately USD 330 million in operational value since 2020, the company's governance approach reveals a fundamental tension: the same technologies that optimize fossil fuel extraction are justified as tools for sustainability, even as the renewables workforce shrinks. Effective governance requires integrating Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) principles with Just Transition guidelines to ensure that efficiency gains **augment rather than merely displace** workers, while capturing opportunities for **new role creation** in AI oversight, data analysis, and human-machine collaboration.

### Three Core Dilemmas (Central Findings)

1. **Efficiency vs Workforce**: Automation displaces certain roles, though new positions may emerge in AI governance, data analysis, and human-machine collaboration (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019). The governance challenge is ensuring workers have **voice and access** to these transitions.
2. **Fossil Lock-in**: Optimization lowers costs and extends fossil fuel asset productivity
3. **Surveillance Risk**: Sensor/monitoring infrastructure blurs optimization and employee surveillance
